# LockAddiction
Prevent  the user from accessing an app they try not to use but use anyway. Inspired by my predicament with games.
Drag and drop files or folders you try to stop yourself from using but can't without deleting them.
User can select the days they want to lock their files.
Reset button has a "deterrent dialog" that will appear soo many times to stop the user from resetting. 
Changing system time breaks everything :(
Plan to remove that exploit by drawing time from the internet when the user is online.
It will run in the background.
First Project. :) :(
